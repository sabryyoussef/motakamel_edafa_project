   ```

3. **Activate Developer Mode → Configure**

   * Set **departments**, **courses**, **batches**, **faculties**
   * Create at least one **student** and **faculty record**

4. **Enable Mail Catcher**

   * Make sure emails work (`settings > outgoing mail servers`)

5. **Snapshot Backup**

   ```bash
   pg_dump -U odoo18 edu_core18 > phase1_core.sql
   ```

✅ *Goal:* Stable OpenEduCat foundation with no errors.

---

## 🧩 **PHASE 2 — ADMINISTRATIVE WORKFLOWS** ✅ COMPLETED

> Admissions, Fees, Parent Portal. Still OpenEduCat only.

### Week 3–4

1. Install:

   ```bash
   odoo-bin -d edu_core18 -i openeducat_admission,openeducat_fees,openeducat_parent
   ```

2. Configure **Admission Pipeline**

   * Stages: *Inquiry → Application → Verification → Approval*
   * Link to Students after approval

3. Configure **Fees**

   * Define Fee Structures (per term, per course)
   * Connect to `account.journal`

4. Enable **Parent Access**

   * Create parent users linked via `res.partner`

5. Run admission → fees → parent workflow end to end

✅ *Goal:* End-to-end admin flow validated.

---

## 🎓 **PHASE 3 — ACADEMIC ENGINE** ✅ COMPLETED

> Deploy academic operations modules.

### Week 5–7

1. Install:

   ```bash
   odoo-bin -d edu_core18 -i openeducat_timetable,openeducat_attendance,openeducat_assignment,openeducat_exam
   ```

2. Configure:

   * Timetable → per batch
   * Attendance → daily/session mode
   * Assignment → enable grading criteria
   * Exams → create exam types, results, and marksheet templates

3. Create test student batch → run a full cycle.

✅ *Goal:* Academic core functional and linked to admin layer.

---

## 📚 **PHASE 4 — RESOURCES & DATA VALIDATION** ✅ COMPLETED

> Add library + reporting + basic analytics.

### Week 8

1. Install:

   ```bash
   odoo-bin -d edu_core18 -i openeducat_library
   ```

2. Configure:

   * Book categories, author lists, rental periods
   * Link `account` for fines

3. Run library transaction tests.

✅ *Goal:* Fully functional academic + resource system.

---

## 🎨 **PHASE 5 — CYBROSYS ENHANCEMENT LAYER** ✅ COMPLETED

> Add UI/UX + promotion + announcements gradually.

### Week 9–10

1. **Install Theme First**

   ```bash
   odoo-bin -d edu_core18 -i education_theme
   ```

   * Check all OpenEduCat views after installation.
   * Fix CSS conflicts under `/static/src/css/`.

2. **Add Promotion Workflow**

   ```bash
   odoo-bin -d edu_core18 -i education_promotion
   ```

   * Test student promotion logic after results.

3. **Add Announcement System**

   ```bash
   odoo-bin -d edu_core18 -i educational_announcement
   ```

   * Integrate announcements for faculty/student dashboards.

4. **Stability Check**

   * Validate: theme, menu positions, no UI conflicts.
   * Take backup snapshot.

✅ *Goal:* UI uplift, promotion logic live, announcements integrated.

---

## 🇪🇬 **PHASE 6 — NTHUB EMS LOCALIZATION & DASHBOARD**

> Upgrade and modularize the 17.0 system.

### Week 11–13

1. **Upgrade Code**

   * Change manifest: `"version": "18.0.1.0.0"`
   * Replace `tree` views → `list`
   * Remove deprecated attrs: `groups="base.group_user"`

2. **Split Modules**

   * `nthub_ems_core`
   * `nthub_ems_marks`
   * `nthub_ems_reports`
   * `nthub_ems_arabic`

3. **Add Arabic Translations**

   * Use `.po` files or Transifex import

   * Fields:

     ```python
     openeducat_student_id = fields.Many2one('op.student')
     cybrosys_student_id = fields.Many2one('education.student')
     nthub_student_id = fields.Many2one('student.student')
     ```

2. Implement `sync_student_data()`

   * Pull data from OpenEduCat
   * Sync name, contact, course, grade to Cybrosys/NTHub

3. Add automated test script

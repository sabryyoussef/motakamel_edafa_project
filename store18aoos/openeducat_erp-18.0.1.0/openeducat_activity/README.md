    student_id = fields.Many2one('op.student', 'Student', required=True)
    faculty_id = fields.Many2one('op.faculty', 'Faculty')
    type_id = fields.Many2one('op.activity.type', 'Activity Type')
    description = fields.Text('Description')
    date = fields.Date('Date', default=fields.Date.today())
    active = fields.Boolean(default=True)
```

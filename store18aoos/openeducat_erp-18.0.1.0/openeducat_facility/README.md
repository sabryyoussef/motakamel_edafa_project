- `op.facility.line` - Facility line management for detailed resource tracking

### Facility Model Structure
```python
class OpFacility(models.Model):
    _name = "op.facility"
    _description = "Facility"
    _inherit = ["mail.thread", "mail.activity.mixin"]
    
    name = fields.Char('Name', required=True)
    code = fields.Char('Code', required=True)
    facility_type = fields.Selection([('classroom', 'Classroom'), 
                                      ('laboratory', 'Laboratory'),
                                      ('library', 'Library'),
                                      ('sports', 'Sports'),
                                      ('auditorium', 'Auditorium')])
    capacity = fields.Integer('Capacity')
    facility_line_ids = fields.One2many('op.facility.line', 'facility_id', 'Facility Lines')
    active = fields.Boolean(default=True)
```

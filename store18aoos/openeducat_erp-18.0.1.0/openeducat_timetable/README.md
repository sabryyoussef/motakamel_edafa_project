## Data Models

### Core Models
- `op.timetable` - Main timetable records
- `op.timing` - Time slot management
- `op.faculty` - Faculty information (inherited from core)

### Timetable Model Structure
```python
class OpTimetable(models.Model):
    _name = "op.timetable"
    _description = "Timetable"
    _inherit = ["mail.thread", "mail.activity.mixin"]
    
    name = fields.Char('Name', required=True)
    course_id = fields.Many2one('op.course', 'Course', required=True)
    batch_id = fields.Many2one('op.batch', 'Batch')
    subject_id = fields.Many2one('op.subject', 'Subject', required=True)
    faculty_id = fields.Many2one('op.faculty', 'Faculty', required=True)
    classroom_id = fields.Many2one('op.classroom', 'Classroom')
    timing_id = fields.Many2one('op.timing', 'Timing', required=True)
    day = fields.Selection([('monday', 'Monday'), ('tuesday', 'Tuesday'),
                           ('wednesday', 'Wednesday'), ('thursday', 'Thursday'),
                           ('friday', 'Friday'), ('saturday', 'Saturday'),
                           ('sunday', 'Sunday')], 'Day', required=True)
    active = fields.Boolean(default=True)
```
